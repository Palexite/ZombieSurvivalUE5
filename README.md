# ZombieSurvivalUE4
**this is more of an educational project for me that im Saving for the future if possible**, to get used to game developing. obviously can't guarentee anything, still learning. no doubt nothing will probably happen. In this project I plan on remastering the Garry's Mod gamemode "Zombie Survival" made by *William "JetBoom" Moodhe* into Unreal Engine 4. The desired theme will probably fit in the lines of the most popular server hosting the gamemode, "Sunrust".  the primary goal is to make it look like the Zombie Survival that is seen today on Garry's Mod. Make Suggestions, comments, reports if you wish. currently, I am a nobody with a goal like any other So don't raise your expectations.
